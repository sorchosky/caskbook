## Git Workflow

### Branch Model

| Branch | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `main` | Production. Auto-deploys to Vercel on merge. Never push directly. |
| `dev` | Integration branch. All work lands here before shipping. Never push directly. |
| `feature/<name>` | New features. Always cut from `dev`. |
| `fix/<name>` | Bug fixes. Always cut from `dev`. |
| `docs/<name>` | Documentation only. Always cut from `dev`. |

### Feature Development

```bash
# 1. Start from an up-to-date dev
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev

# 2. Cut a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/<name>

# 3. Do your work, then commit
git add <files>
git commit -m "feat: short description"

# 4. Push and open a PR targeting dev
git push -u origin feature/<name>
```

Open a PR from `feature/<name>` → `dev`. After merge, delete the feature branch.

### Shipping to Production

When `dev` is stable and ready to release, open a PR from `dev` → `main`. Merging that PR triggers an automatic Vercel deployment — no additional steps required.
